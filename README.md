TCS
---

This is a basic frontend I use to control my arcade cabinet.

TCS is short for TjebCadeStarter

It creates a window with buttons that execute up to three commands.

It also includes a directory with xmodmap files; one of the main 
reasons I created this was to be able to redefine my X key settings 
for certain programs.

To run it, simply cd into the main directory and call ./tcs.py

The first time you'll need to run ./tcs.py --init to generate an
example configuration file. By default this will be stored in tcs.conf.

The configuration file should speak for itself.
